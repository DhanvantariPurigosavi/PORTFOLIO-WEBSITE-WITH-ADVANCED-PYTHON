OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT
How It Works
API Integration:

The script fetches weather forecast data for the next 5 days (in 3-hour intervals) for a specified city.
Data includes temperature, humidity, and weather descriptions.
Data Processing:

The JSON response is converted into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.
Columns: datetime, temperature, humidity, weather_description.
Data Visualization:

Two visualizations are generated:
Temperature Trend: A line chart showing temperature changes over time.
Humidity Trend: A line chart showing humidity changes over time

Deliverables
Script: A Python script integrating the OpenWeatherMap API and visualizing the data.
Dashboard: Visualizations for temperature and humidity trends.
